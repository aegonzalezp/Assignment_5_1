Assignment 5_1 Summary

Dataset
This data comes to us from the UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on 
Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, 
current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon 
if he is the driver. Answers that the user will drive there ‘right away’ or ‘later before the coupon 
expires’ are labeled as ‘Y = 1’ and answers ‘no, I do not want the coupon’ are labeled as ‘Y = 0’. 
There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, 
carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50). 

Summary of findings
The study so far focused on two types of coupons

1. Bar Coupon
2. Restaurants $20 to $50 Coupon
